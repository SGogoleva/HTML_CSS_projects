        <h1>About the project</h1>
        <p>This idea came to me together with my best friends. I needed some ideas for my portfolio and asked my dearest girls, what kind of resource they would like to use. At that same minute, they came up about the Bullet-Journal idea. This is very usefull to check on your daily routine, or if you want to bring new habbit in your life, starting with the sport on daily basis ending with facial treatment. Tracking your daily activity helps us to analyze what we are doing reguralry well or what is needed to be worked on. <strong>If you are eager to support and be proud of yourself, your amazing journey starts from here!</strong></p>
